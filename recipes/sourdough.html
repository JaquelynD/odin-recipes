        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Always better than storebought, sourdough is a healthy simple option</p>
        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>125g Active soudough starter</li>
            <li>454g Flour</li>
            <li>325g Spring water</li>
            <li>10g Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>ensure you have fed your starter and it has doubled in size</li>
            <li>Mix the water and sourdough starter in a large bowl</li>
            <li>on top of the water/starter mixture, add flour and 10 g of a good quality salt</li>
            <li>mix until a shaggy dough forms, cover with a damp kitchen towl and allow to sit for an hour</li>
            <li>for the next 4 hours, every half hour, fold the dough and re cover it</li>
            <li>dust a clean workspace with flour and place the dough down, stretch it into a rectangle 
                and fold the dough into the shape of the baneton you have, allow the dough to bench rest for a half hour</li>
            <li>work the dough again by flattening it, and folding it over on itself until you get a nice shape</li>
            <li>place the dough into a dusted banteton (rice flour works very well) cover and place in the fridge over night</li>
            <li>the next day, preheat a dutch oven in a 450F oven</li>
            <li>take the dough out of the fridge and turn the baneton over onto a piece of parchment paper</li>
            <li>using a sharp razor, score the length of the dough creating a long cut in the "skin" of the dough</li>
            <li>place the dough into the preheated dutch oven and toss in one icecube, cover and bake for 35 minutes</li>
            <li>after 35 minutes, take the cover off the dutch oven and bake for another 15-20 minutes</li>
            <li>take bread out of the oven and allow to cool completely before slicing</li>
